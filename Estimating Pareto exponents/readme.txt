To replicate the Pareto exponent estimates, as well as the test statistics reported in Appendix Table C, follow the steps:


- Go to the LIS website: https://www.lisdatacenter.org/ and login to LISSY

- Navigate to edit job, select project: LIS, Package: R

- Copy paste the text file: "LIS code 5percent HILL.txt" (This gives the Pareto exponents for labor income for all countries in our sample.
							  Change "hilabour" to "hicapital" at the very bottom of the code to get the estimates
							  for capital income (see the comment in the code))

- Copy paste the text file: "LIS code 5 percent Hoga test.txt" (This gives the test results for testing the equality of Pareto exponents for
								capital and labour income)
